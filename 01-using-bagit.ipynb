    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The above activity showed the steps in creating fixity and basic descriptive information - **metadata** - for this group of files. Using an agreed-upon file packaging specification, like BagIt, allows digital curators \n",
    "to create information packages that contain basic information about the contents, and can \n",
    "help organizations exchanging content to ensure that the content that was sent was the content that was received.\n",
    "Moreover, keeping this information together can allow a repository, its maintainers, and its users, to \n",
    "be able to have some assurance that information received now is the same as that originally received.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopted and used within many digital collection workflows in major libraries, including the Library of Congress, California Digital Library, large research libraries, and some state and government archives.\n",
    "- Can be easily opened and understood by standard operating systems and software on the Web, on desktop computers, laptops, and networked systems.\n",
    "- Relatively simple to add files to update, add, and delete information prior to transfer\n",
    "- Does not require or rely upon file encoding, compression, or proprietary software to create or to open\n",
    "- Reliably create and confirm the fixity of information and the completeness of digital objects in a group, according to accompanying information.\n",
    "- The file structure helps to group descriptive metadata with the content it describes, using standard filesystem tools available on most operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux). \n",
    "- Content transmitted and received can easily be opened with standard tools, which could be useful for providing information to patrons and users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not work well in a production or processing environment. If you are actively creating files, or adding them\n",
    "to a folder, you don't want to create and update BagIt information every time you make a change. \n",
    "- The information in bag-info.txt is uncontrolled. While the specification does recommend some labels,\n",
    "there is a large room for ambiguity or confusion to be created when different units or organizations\n",
    "are creating metadata or bags in various workflows. \n",
    "- For robust projects with highly structured and consistent\n",
    "packages (like the Chronicling America project), bag validation must be accompanied by additional quality \n",
    "checks to understand if content is, indeed, \"complete\" (beyond just matching what was sent). In other words, if you \n",
    "are sent incomplete or faulty data, BagIt is not a tool that will help you solve that problem, though it might\n",
    "(or might not) be one that can help you to identify the problem.\n",
    "- If used in a digital repository workflow, additional documentation and strategies must accompany the process (see below for how some libraries have managed this sort of distributed environment).\n",
