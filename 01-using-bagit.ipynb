    "# Preparing Digital Objects for Transfer and Storage Using BagIt\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a short introduction to one challenge of digital curation -\n",
    "how do you know what was sent to you? how do you know if what you have was really what was sent? -\n",
    "how those questions can be answered in part with preservation metadata - what that is, and how it can be made useful -\n",
    "and then demonstrates briefly how basic metadata might be created with the help of the \n",
    "_BagIt_ protocol, which is widely used among digital cultural heritage institutions.\n",
    "The approach here demonstrates the use of the python `bagit` library, a tool that is useful in creating and \n",
    "validating digital objects in the broader context of preparing data for storage, monitoring it for \n",
    "stability over time, and creating trustworthy copies and transfers of digital information. \n",
    "While this tool is not a standard piece of office software, it does offer a relatively simple\n",
    "way to create essential preservation information about groups of digital files, which can be\n",
    "used by very large cultural heritage organizations (such as the Library of Congress, California\n",
    "Digital Library) but also by smaller organizations (you can create this information for any directory\n",
    "of files using your laptop and this Jupyter notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo was created with a few assumptions. In particular, I'm assuming that you have some level of\n",
    "comfort with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- working with files on a computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or other filesystem environments),\n",
    "- that you can find and open them from an Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) graphical interface, \n",
    "- that you have done a some basic navigation in a shell environment (e.g., Terminal or Bash shell or GitBash) including finding files and directories,  \n",
    "- you have a familiarity with the Python programming language, including using it from an interactive notebook environment (Jupyter notebooks), and that\n",
    "- downloading and operating Jupyter notebooks and repos from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the concepts, file actions, Python code, and tools are explained below, but understanding the above will help you work through the materials. The activities outlined here are based on a larger sequence of digital curation activities and tools that I developed in 2018 and 2019 while teaching digital curation courses at the University of Maryland iSchool."

    "## Metadata and where it fits in the lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further to talk about file metadata and what it looks like in BagIt, \n",
    "let's place this in the context of the larger realm of digital curation and preservation. \n",
    "To start, make a brief review of the digital curation lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Digital Curation Lifecycle](images/lifecycle_web.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of what we are talking about (the inner orange and yellow circles), the activities \n",
    "under discussion here are focused largely on \"digital objects,\" which might include things like discrete\n",
    "files, groups of files, and other generally static entities; in terms of the model, this does not include databases\n",
    "or other digital things that might be queried or dynamically generated.\n",
    "- Along with the digital object, we expect to have some level of description: in this case,\n",
    "more than information about what the thing is, think of things like filenames, file size,\n",
    "date of creation, who has access to a resource and what they can do with it. Basically information that \n",
    "may be usefully described as administrative and technical metadata; that is, who has access and \n",
    "what information about the nature of the thing. (We won't much be talking about descrpitive information\n",
    "in the sense of describing the content here.)\n",
    "- Moving out to the Curate/Preserve ring, most of what is going on here is done to preserve existing digital files. At the point that we are packaging files and creating technical metadata, we might assume that there has already been a choice somewhere along the line that these materials are ones that we want to manage as part of our collection, repository, or other organizational unit. \n",
    "- Finally, in the outer magenta-colored ring, which lists digital curation actions, the areas where we might most likely expect to find structures, metadata, and tools like those under discussion today, are the \"Create or Receive,\" \"Ingest,\" \"Preservation Action,\" and \"Store.\" It's possible that fixity information might be used in other areas as well, but it would likely not be as closely connected to a structure like BagIt.

    "## What is Fixity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity refers to whether or not a piece of information has changed or not. For digital objects, the process of creating \"[checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum),\" which are algorithmically calculated values created based on the sequence of bits indexed in a file, is the most widely used technique to establish and evaluate file fixity. Various [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), developed in cryptography (for encoding information), may be used, including `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-2`, and others. Fixity is often treated as a metadata property, and fixity can be assessed using that metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity information can be useful in answering questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Is this file that I'm receiving the same as the one that you sent to me?\" \n",
    "- \"Is this file that we are storing now the same as the one that was received previously (whether a few days, months, or years later)?\"\n",
    "\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The above activity showed the steps in creating fixity and basic descriptive information - **metadata** - for this group of files. Using an agreed-upon file packaging specification, like BagIt, allows digital curators \n",
    "to create information packages that contain basic information about the contents, and can \n",
    "help organizations exchanging content to ensure that the content that was sent was the content that was received.\n",
    "Moreover, keeping this information together can allow a repository, its maintainers, and its users, to \n",
    "be able to have some assurance that information received now is the same as that originally received.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adopted and used within many digital collection workflows in major libraries, including the Library of Congress, California Digital Library, large research libraries, and some state and government archives.\n",
    "- Can be easily opened and understood by standard operating systems and software on the Web, on desktop computers, laptops, and networked systems.\n",
    "- Relatively simple to add files to update, add, and delete information prior to transfer\n",
    "- Does not require or rely upon file encoding, compression, or proprietary software to create or to open\n",
    "- Reliably create and confirm the fixity of information and the completeness of digital objects in a group, according to accompanying information.\n",
    "- The file structure helps to group descriptive metadata with the content it describes, using standard filesystem tools available on most operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux). \n",
    "- Content transmitted and received can easily be opened with standard tools, which could be useful for providing information to patrons and users. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does not work well in a production or processing environment. If you are actively creating files, or adding them\n",
    "to a folder, you don't want to create and update BagIt information every time you make a change. \n",
    "- The information in bag-info.txt is uncontrolled. While the specification does recommend some labels,\n",
    "there is a large room for ambiguity or confusion to be created when different units or organizations\n",
    "are creating metadata or bags in various workflows. \n",
    "- For robust projects with highly structured and consistent\n",
    "packages (like the Chronicling America project), bag validation must be accompanied by additional quality \n",
    "checks to understand if content is, indeed, \"complete\" (beyond just matching what was sent). In other words, if you \n",
    "are sent incomplete or faulty data, BagIt is not a tool that will help you solve that problem, though it might\n",
    "(or might not) be one that can help you to identify the problem.\n",
    "- If used in a digital repository workflow, additional documentation and strategies must accompany the process (see below for how some libraries have managed this sort of distributed environment).\n",
