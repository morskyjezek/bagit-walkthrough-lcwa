    "# Creating Basic Technical Metadata for Preservation with BagIt\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo was created with a few assumptions. In particular, I'm assuming that you have some level of\n",
    "comfort with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- working with files on a computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or other filesystem environments),\n",
    "- that you can find and open them from an Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) graphical interface, \n",
    "- that you have done a some basic navigation in a shell environment (e.g., Terminal or Bash shell or GitBash) including finding files and directories,  \n",
    "- you have a familiarity with the Python programming language, including using it from an interactive notebook environment (Jupyter notebooks), and that\n",
    "- downloading and operating Jupyter notebooks and repos from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the concepts, file actions, Python code, and tools are explained below, but understanding the above will help you work through the materials. The activities outlined here are based on a larger sequence of digital curation activities and tools that I developed in 2018 and 2019 while teaching digital curation courses at the University of Maryland iSchool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction - Why is this important? What is the challenge we're trying to solve? \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that one of you has a group of files. It might be the digitized pages of a book, a computer-generated copy of the text (perhaps generated by Optical Character Recognition, or OCR), and bibliographic information (publication date, \n",
    "author(s), editor(s), copyright, etc). Although these may be discrete files, they are related and\n",
    "only together create a coherent digital copy of the book. Or perhaps you have digitized a sound recording, and you \n",
    "have a group of sound files that are the tracks of the recording, a digital version of liner notes or other\n",
    "information like a picture of the artist, and publication information. These are a group of sound files, images, and\n",
    "text information. Or perhaps you have been collecting information posted on social media about Covid vaccination, which might include images, text captions, usernames, posting dates, and accompanying comments. Each of these things, whether a book, an audio recording, or an Instagram or Twitter post, may have multiple files that together create a digital object.\n",
    "\n",
    "![file-system-image here]\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's say that you want to preserve these for access later. Possibly for access by yourself, but likely for broader usage, in an archive or library of the future. Along with a general description of what the things are, you want to \n",
    "make sure that you include a list of the digital elements that you're including with the deposit. You want to make sure that there is a complete list of the entities that comprise this object, and you also want to have a way to confirm that the items you've assembled together are received altogether by the organization that you want to send it to. And in five or ten years, or more, you want to have a way to confirm that there hasn't been any problems or events that have compromised\n",
    "the data that you're including. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Metadata and where it fits in the lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a short introduction to preservation metadata - what it is, why it is important, \n",
    "and when it may be most useful -\n",
    "and then demonstrates briefly how basic metadata might be created with the help of the storage \n",
    "protocol _BagIt_, widely used among digital cultural heritage institutions. The approach here is \n",
    "to demonstrate the use of the python `bagit` library, a tool that is useful in creating and \n",
    "validating digital objects in the broader context of preparing data for storage, monitoring it for \n",
    "stability over time, and creating trustworthy copies and transfers of digital information. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, let's place this in the context of the larger realm of digital curation and preservation. \n",
    "To start, make a brief review of the digital curation lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Digital Curation Lifecycle](images/lifecycle_web.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of what we are talking about (the inner orange and yellow circles), the activities \n",
    "under discussion here are focused largely on \"digital objects,\" which might include things like discrete\n",
    "files, groups of files, and other generally static entities; in terms of the model, this does not include databases\n",
    "or other digital things that might be queried or dynamically generated.\n",
    "- Along with the digital object, we expect to have some level of description: in this case,\n",
    "more than information about what the thing is, think of things like filenames, file size,\n",
    "date of creation, who has access to a resource and what they can do with it. Basically information that \n",
    "may be usefully described as administrative and technical metadata; that is, who has access and \n",
    "what information about the nature of the thing. (We won't much be talking about descrpitive information\n",
    "in the sense of describing the content here.)\n",
    "- Moving out to the Curate/Preserve ring, most of what is going on here is done to preserve existing digital files. At the point that we are packaging files and creating technical metadata, we might assume that there has already been a choice somewhere along the line that these materials are ones that we want to manage as part of our collection, repository, or other organizational unit. \n",
    "- Finally, in the outer magenta-colored ring, which lists digital curation actions, the areas where we might most likely expect to find structures, metadata, and tools like those under discussion today, are the \"Create or Receive,\" \"Ingest,\" \"Preservation Action,\" and \"Store.\" It's possible that fixity information might be used in other areas as well, but it would likely not be as closely connected to a structure like BagIt.

    "## What is Fixity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity refers to whether or not a piece of information has changed or not. For digital objects, the process of creating \"[checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum),\" which are algorithmically calculated values created based on the sequence of bits indexed in a file, is the most widely used technique to establish and evaluate file fixity. Various [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), developed in cryptography (for encoding information), may be used, including `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-2`, and others. Fixity is often treated as a metadata property, and fixity can be assessed using that metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity information can be useful in answering questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Is this file that I'm receiving the same as the one that you sent to me?\" \n",
    "- \"Is this file that we are storing now the same as the one that was received previously (whether a few days, months, or years later)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "BagIt helps us to create fixity information by providing all of the tools that you need to create checksums and connect them to the digital information that you are sending or storing."

    "## What Is BagIt?\n",
    "\n",
    "BagIt is a packaging specification used by many digital libraries to assemble, document,\n",
    "transfer, and verify digital content. The idea is to place selected content\n",
    "into a \"bag\" that conforms to the [BagIt specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-14),\n",
    "which contains a basic description (bag-info.txt), a checksum manifest,\n",
    "and data payload. The general concept is that the package is \"self describing\" (the description\n",
    "acts like a \"tag\" on a physical bag naming the contents) and verifiable (using the\n",
    "checksum manifest).\n",
    "\n",
    "This format has been adopted in many settings. Various digital libraries, including the\n",
    "[California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/cdlinfo/2008/07/02/bagit-transferring-digital-content/),\n",
    "[Digital Preservation Network](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JqKMFn9KfeIMAAEdOGQr6LZPqNWx8Qubi12uoUXi2QU/edit),\n",
    "and others, have adopted the specification as a generalized format\n",
    "for submission and transfer of information (a SIP). Moreover, various tools, like\n",
    "[Exactly](https://www.weareavp.com/products/exactly/) have been developed that use the BagIt standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BagIt structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Data packaged according to the BagIt specification 1.x follows this general schema\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<main folder>/\n",
    " | bag-info.txt\n",
    " | bagit.txt\n",
    " | manifest-sha256.txt\n",
    " | tagmanifest-sha256.txt\n",
    " \\--- data/\n",
    " | [payload files]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data` subfolder contains the content. The other files in the main folder contain\n",
    "information about the contents:\n",
    " * `bag-info.txt` contains all metadata entered by the packager (information you configure in the `-profile.json` file)\n",
    " * `manifest-sh256.txt` contains a manifest of all the files in the `data` folder and their checksums\n",
    " * `tagmanifest-sha256.txt` contains a manifest of the files and checksums of the contents of the main folder\n",
    " * `bagit.txt` identifies the version of BagIt specification  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assembling files\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagger allows you to gather files into bags in two ways: using the GUI interface to select files,\n",
    "or assembling the files and then generating the bag structure based on the way you already have theme\n",
    "assembled. We're going to use this latter way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put information into a structure that lets you store it in a coherent way. For example,\n",
    "it may be sufficient to have all files in one folder. Perhaps you have a series of images in both\n",
    "high-resolution preservation files and lower-resolution access derivatives.\n",
    "Other cases may suggest a hierarchical structure of folders. For example,\n",
    "you may want a series of folders and subfolders that correspond to the chapters of a\n",
    "book or other smaller semantic units; or perhaps large groupings demand deeper and\n",
    "more nested hierarchies (eg, a [pairtree](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/PairTree) structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you assemble the files, it's useful to name them according to a standard protocol,\n",
    "which would be determined by the repository where you plan to store the bag.\n",
    "For example, the State Archives of North Carolina suggest that all BagIt bags should\n",
    "have a top folder name with that ends in `_bag` as a quick indicator that a folder\n",
    "represents a bag (note that while useful, this naming convention does not guarantee\n",
    "that the folder in quesiton is a *valid* BagIt bag).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the files organized as you wish to store them, you are ready to create the \n",
    "bag. Although a relatively basic process once everything is set up, this step accomplishes \n",
    "the complicated work of generating the baginfo.txt file and requisite data integrity checksums.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This activity will use a Python library to prepare a group of sample files according to the BagIt specification. Various other ways of creating bags are discussed below in this notebook. "

    "\n",
    "The purpose of the “bag” is to create information about the file structure, basic information that can demonstrate that the information has not changed, and to provide basic context (information about where the files came from, who filed them, and what they are).

    "Now we have created basic fixity and preservation metadata for this group of files, two types of fixity signatures (sha256 and sha512), and an inventory of the files (see `neh-grants-data-202012/manifest-sha256.txt`). This will serve as a basic description of the original files. In the next activities, we will continue to work with this information, but the original files will remain unchanged and available for further consultation or work beyond this project. All of our work will be to extract, transform, and clean the data that we pull from these files, which will be the basis for further computation, visualization, or other analysis."
