    "# Preparing Digital Objects for Transfer and Storage Using BagIt\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a short introduction to one challenge of digital curation -\n",
    "how do you know what was sent to you? how do you know if what you have was really what was sent? -\n",
    "how those questions can be answered in part with preservation metadata - what that is, and how it can be made useful -\n",
    "and then demonstrates briefly how basic metadata might be created with the help of the \n",
    "_BagIt_ protocol, which is widely used among digital cultural heritage institutions.\n",
    "The approach here demonstrates the use of the python `bagit` library, a tool that is useful in creating and \n",
    "validating digital objects in the broader context of preparing data for storage, monitoring it for \n",
    "stability over time, and creating trustworthy copies and transfers of digital information. \n",
    "While this tool is not a standard piece of office software, it does offer a relatively simple\n",
    "way to create essential preservation information about groups of digital files, which can be\n",
    "used by very large cultural heritage organizations (such as the Library of Congress, California\n",
    "Digital Library) but also by smaller organizations (you can create this information for any directory\n",
    "of files using your laptop and this Jupyter notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo was created with a few assumptions. In particular, I'm assuming that you have some level of\n",
    "comfort with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- working with files on a computer (Windows, Mac, Linux, or other filesystem environments),\n",
    "- that you can find and open them from an Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac) graphical interface, \n",
    "- that you have done a some basic navigation in a shell environment (e.g., Terminal or Bash shell or GitBash) including finding files and directories,  \n",
    "- you have a familiarity with the Python programming language, including using it from an interactive notebook environment (Jupyter notebooks), and\n",
    "- downloading and operating Jupyter notebooks and repos from GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the concepts, file actions, Python code, and tools are explained below, but understanding the above will help you work through the materials. The activities outlined here are based on a larger sequence of digital curation activities and tools that I developed in 2018 and 2019 while teaching digital curation courses at the University of Maryland iSchool."

    "## Context: In the Curation Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going further to talk about file metadata and what it looks like in BagIt, \n",
    "let's place this in the context of the larger realm of digital curation and preservation. \n",
    "To start, make a brief review of the digital curation lifecycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Digital Curation Lifecycle](images/lifecycle_web.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "BagIt is an approach that can be used to create and check preservation metadata\n",
    "for files that are being prepared for a digital repository. Where would this be \n",
    "important for the curation lifecycle?\n",
    "\n",
    "- In terms of what we are talking about (the inner orange and yellow circles), the activities \n",
    "under discussion here are focused largely on \"digital objects,\" which might include things like discrete\n",
    "files, groups of files, and other generally static entities; in terms of the model, this does not include databases\n",
    "or other digital things that might be queried or dynamically generated.\n",
    "- Along with the digital object, we expect to have some level of description: in this case,\n",
    "more than information about what the thing is, think of things like filenames, file size,\n",
    "date of creation, who has access to a resource and what they can do with it. Basically information that \n",
    "may be usefully described as administrative and technical metadata; that is, who has access and \n",
    "what information about the nature of the thing. (We won't much be talking about descrpitive information\n",
    "in the sense of describing the content here.)\n",
    "- Moving out to the Curate/Preserve ring, most of what is going on here is done to preserve existing digital files. At the point that we are packaging files and creating technical metadata, we might assume that there has already been a choice somewhere along the line that these materials are ones that we want to manage as part of our collection, repository, or other organizational unit. \n",
    "- Finally, in the outer magenta-colored ring, which lists digital curation actions, the areas where we might most likely expect to find structures, metadata, and tools like those under discussion today, are the \"Create or Receive,\" \"Ingest,\" \"Preservation Action,\" and \"Store.\" It's possible that fixity information might be used in other areas as well, but it would likely not be as closely connected to a structure like BagIt.

    "## What is Fixity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity refers to whether or not a piece of information has changed or not. For digital objects, the process of creating \"[checksums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum),\" which are algorithmically calculated values created based on the sequence of bits indexed in a file, is the most widely used technique to establish and evaluate file fixity. Various [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), developed in cryptography (for encoding information), may be used, including `MD5`, `SHA-1`, `SHA-2`, and others. Fixity is often treated as a metadata property, and fixity can be assessed using that metadata. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fixity information can be useful in answering questions like: \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Is this file that I'm receiving the same as the one that you sent to me?\" \n",
    "- \"Is this file that we are storing now the same as the one that was received previously (whether a few days, months, or years later)?\"\n",

    "## One Answer: BagIt, a specification and accompanying tools\n",
    "\n",
    "[BagIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt) is a packaging specification used by many digital libraries to\n",
    "assemble, document, transfer, and verify digital content. The idea is to place selected content\n",
    "into a \"bag\" that conforms to the [BagIt specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kunze-bagit-14),\n",
    "which contains a basic description (bag-info.txt), a checksum manifest,\n",
    "and data payload. The general concept is that the package is \"self describing\" (the description\n",
    "acts like a \"tag\" on a physical bag naming the contents) and verifiable (using the\n",
    "checksum manifest).\n",
    "\n",
    "BagIt is explained and defined in a standalone Request for Comments document from the \n",
    "Internet Engineering Taskforce, so it is not only used in libraries and archvies, but also\n",

    "The specification was developed around 2005 and 2006 by the California Digital Library and\n",

    "\n",
    "When you assemble the files, it's useful to name them according to a standard pattern,\n",
    "which would be determined by the repository where you plan to store the bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, the State Archives of North Carolina suggest that all BagIt bags should\n",
    "have a top folder name with that ends in `_bag` as a quick indicator that a folder\n",

    "agencies who coordinate the scanning of microfilm, creation of specific metadata for each issue\n",
    "and newspaper title, and are then bagged (packaged) in batches corresponding to microfilm reels\n",
    "then sent to the Library of Congress where they are validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put information into a structure that lets you store it in a coherent way. For example,\n",
    "it may be sufficient to have all files in one folder. Perhaps you have a series of images in both\n",
    "high-resolution preservation files and lower-resolution access derivatives.\n",
    "Other cases may suggest a hierarchical structure of folders. For example,\n",
    "you may want a series of folders and subfolders that correspond to the chapters of a\n",
    "book or other smaller semantic units; or perhaps large groupings demand deeper and\n",
    "more nested hierarchies (eg, a [pairtree](https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/PairTree) structure).\n",
